This project was done for my Python for Data Science class during my junior year at Purdue.

The class was taught by Professor Murat Kocaoglu. 

This project was much more open ended than others here in my portfolio so there is less to clarify here
in the readMe. 

The big picture of this project is this:

We were given a CVS with data on the amount of precipitation, the temperature, and the bike traffic for 
a certain amount of days on multiple different bridges in NYC. Given this data we were tasked to answer 3 key 
question which I think are the best way to understand the project:

1. If traffic sensors were to be installed on 3 of the 4 bridges in order to most accurately represent
   the total overall bike traffic on NYC bridges, which bridge should be left without a sensor?
2. If the city wants to use weather predictions to control how many police officers they have out to hand
   tickets to cyclists without helmets, can they do this and if so, how?
3. Can you accurately predict if its raining or not based on the number of cyclists out on the bridges?

The code can be found in the "biketraffic.py" file, and an in-depth technical brief can be found in "report.pdf"
